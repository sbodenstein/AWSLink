# Wolfram Language Interface to Amazon Web Services (AWS)

AWSLink is a package for interacting with AWS inside the [Wolfram Language](https://www.wolfram.com/language/). It interfaces to the [AWS Java SDK.](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/) via JLink.

Only a tiny subset of AWS functionality is currently exposed in AWSLink. If you want something that is missing, please request it in the Github Issues. Or better yet, add it and submit a Pull Request!

### Where did this come from?

AWSLink is a paclet maintained by Sebastian Bodenstein and Timothee Verdier of Wolfram Research. It is used within Wolfram Research by the Machine Learning Group to easily launch and manage EC2 instances.
